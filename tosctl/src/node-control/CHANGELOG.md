## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **JWT-based authentication for REST API** — login, token revocation, auth middleware with login rate limiter, argon2 password hashing, and `TOSCTL_API_TOKEN` env support; new `auth` and `api login` CLI commands
- **Election status dashboard** — `/v1/elections` API endpoint and `tosctl api elections` CLI table with participation lifecycle tracking (Idle → Participating → Submitted → Accepted → Elected → Validating), stake sums, and election metadata
- **Validation keys listing** — `/v1/validators` API endpoint and `tosctl api validators` command displays validator information including validator key with election ID, created/expires timestamps, validator status, key ID, and ADNL address
- **Kubernetes internal DNS support** — control server address now accepts DNS names (e.g. `validator-0-control.tos.svc.cluster.local`) in addition to IP addresses
- **JWT authorization in Swagger UI** — added `bearerAuth` security scheme to OpenAPI spec; Swagger UI now shows an "Authorize" button for Bearer token authentication
- **`--filter` for elections and validators API** — `tosctl api elections` and `tosctl api validators` accept `--filter=<name>` to limit output to specific nodes
- **`--format=json|table` flag** — added `--format=json|table` flag to all `config ... ls` subcommands (`config bind ls`, `config elections ls`, `config log ls`, `config node ls`, `config pool ls`, `config wallet ls`, `master-wallet ls`)

### Changed

- **Bounceable base64 wallet addresses** — `config wallet ls` now displays addresses in bounceable URL-safe base64 format
- **Improved endpoint round-robin** — lowered retry loop log level to debug, shortened error messages when all endpoints fail, fixed `rr_cursor` initial value starting from 1 instead of 0
- **Graceful RPC error handling in `wallet ls`** — wallet listing no longer fails when the RPC API is unreachable; addresses are still displayed with `-` for unavailable state/balance fields; unified warning format
- **Hot reload for auth state** — JWT TTL changes, newly added users, and token revocations take effect on config reload without service restart; JWT signing key is generated on first start even if auth is disabled
- **Extended version command** — `tosctl --version` now prints build artifacts (git hash, build date, features)
- **Updated documentation** — added descriptions for new commands and flags, fixed documentation errors, added document on `tosctl` security model, added documentation for first elections with Rust node, added documentation for REST API authentication

### Fixed

- **`State` column alignment in `wallet ls`** — adjusted column width to fix misalignment in `config wallet ls` output
- **Missing OpenAPI schema references** — registered `ElectionsStatus`, `NodeListRequest`, and nested election schemas (`OurElectionParticipant`, `ParticipationStatus`, `StakeSubmission`) in OpenAPI components, fixing Swagger resolver errors

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Manual election stake command** — new `config wallet stake` command for manual election participation via nominator pool.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Wallet V4/V5 support** — added support for wallet contracts v4 and v5, including address verification and code hash validation
- **Log file rotation and cleanup** — moved logging configuration into the JSON config file under a `log` section with support for size-based and time-based rotation, configurable max file count and size, and three output modes: `console`, `file`, `all`
- **Multi-endpoint failover for tos-http-api** — round-robin failover across multiple RPC endpoints with per-endpoint API keys; new `tos-http-api add` CLI command to append failover endpoints
- **Pool address and balance display** — `config pool ls` resolves pool contract addresses and shows live balances via the RPC API; added pool and owner address validation
- **Log settings CLI** — new `config log ls` and `config log set` commands for viewing and updating log level, rotation, output mode, and file path without editing the config file manually
- **Control server connection status** — `config node ls` shows each node's control server connection status (e.g. "OK" or an error message), using concurrent ADNL pings with a 5-second timeout
- **Vault hot reload** — the vault is now reopened on each config reload so newly added secrets are picked up without a service restart; config and dynamic state swap is atomic
- **Missing vault secret warnings** — `config node add` and `config wallet add` now warn when the specified secret name does not exist in the vault
- **Balance parsing from string or integer** — new `u64_as_str_or_num` serde helper to accept `u64` values serialized as either JSON string or number, fixing TonCenter API v2 balance deserialization

### Changed

- **Migrated to Axum web framework** — replaced the previous web framework with Axum for the control HTTP server
- **Removed `--verbose` and `--log-file` CLI flags** — log level can still be overridden via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable
- **Backward-compatible config migration** — old `"url": "…"` field in tos-http-api config is transparently migrated to `urls` on first re-save
- Updated tosctl documentation to reflect current configuration and usage

### Fixed

- **Deploy only unique wallets** — when a single wallet is configured for multiple nodes, it is now deployed only once
- **Wallet send `--bounce` flag and confirmation default** — fixed `--bounce` flag handling and clarified the default confirmation prompt
- **Wallet version help text case insensitivity** — updated wallet version help text to reflect case-insensitive input

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Wallet V1R3 support** — added support for wallet contract v1r3

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

Initial release.
